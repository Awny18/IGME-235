        <h2>Description</h2>
    
            <p>Apprentice engineer, Link, is ready to travel to Hyrule 
                Castle and receive his engineer's license - and meet Princess 
                Zelda herself! However, during the ceremony, Zelda slips Link a 
                note warning him not to trust the Chancellor, and to help her reach 
                the Spirit Tower. The land's Spirit Tracks (mystical railway 
                tracks that cover the land) have been disappearing, and she 
                suspects that the Chancellor is the cause. While heading to the Tower, 
                the Chancellor intercepts them, and proves Zelda's suspicions right - 
                he casts a magic spell on her, splitting her body from her soul! 
                Link and Zelda must work together to return Zelda to normal and save Hyrule once again. [...]</p>

        <h2>Quote</h2>
    
            <blockquote><p>While the story is not that much different from earlier games, 
                the large, stunning and vibrant 3D world, memorable characters and lovable
                 music made it much more epic than before. This is the main reason why many 
                 people find it the greatest game they ever played, I personally am one of them.
